# Production Environment Variables for Render
# These are used when deploying to production
# DO NOT commit real secrets - use Render dashboard environment variables instead

# This file is here to prevent .env.local from being loaded in production
# Actual secrets should be set in Render dashboard: Settings → Environment

# Render will use its own environment variables which override this file
